# Create-Desktop-Notifier-App-in-Python

Python Project – A desktop notifier app can keep track of your to-do list and ensure you don’t miss any important deadlines. This Python project involves building a simple app that displays notifications on your desktop when a task is due. It will help you learn the Python requests module to fetch data from a remote API, how to use the Python Pillow module to generate images, and how to use the Python pynotifier module to display notifications. By the end of this project, you’ll have a useful tool that you can use to stay organised.
